            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S nothing can demonſtrate to the world the ſincerity of the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a State better then their own publick actions: ſo the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their reſolutions can never be manifeſted more clearly, then when carried on through va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of difficulties: the truth whereof doth herein moſt evidently appear. At the commence of this Parliament, while yet the kingdom was in peace, both Houſes paſſed an Act, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they did manifeſt unto the world their reſolutions of undertaking that Chriſtian work of the redemption of the Captives taken by Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh, Mooriſh, and other Pirats, from that cruel thraldome which they lay under: immediately after the paſsing whereof, this unnaturall war was by the malice of the Kingdomes enemies formented and continued, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:159930:3"/>enwrapped in miſery, and to be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by both Houſes of Parliament, from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall oppreſsion which it groaned under. Whereby indeed that work of the redemption of the Captives was for a time interrupted in its progreſsion: and had the Parliament looked on thing only according to humane reaſon they might well have altogether deferred the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking at that time that ſo great an action, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to a forein State, ſo remote as Africa: yet with a proportionall equality of care to releaſe the whole, and its ſeverall part, thoſe principles that firſt moved them, kept up their reſolutions in the midſt of the ſtorme, yea quickned them on: To that purpoſe in the year 1645 they ſet forth a ſhip of ſtrength called the <hi>Honour,</hi> laden with a Gargaſoon of money and goods, to a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: ſending <hi>Edmond Caſon</hi> Eſq. their Agent, with Power and inſtructions to go for Argier, to treat for the releaſe of the Engliſh Captives from thence, and ſetling of a future peace, for ſecurity of the Marchants and Mariners voyage. But it ſo pleaſed the Divine Providence (to whoſe guidance all things ſubmit) that the ſaid ſhip) with her lading, comming to anchor, (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of contrary windes,) in the Road of Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:159930:3"/>was there by accident ſet on fire, all poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means uſed to quench it, but with no effect, the goods by violence of the inhabitants of the place taken away, and not by the Agent to be recovered: ſome monies that were ſaved were put on board another Engliſh ſhip called the <hi>Diamond,</hi> at that time riding in the Bay but the <hi>Diamond</hi> a while after, before her return to England, was caſt away near <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and ſo the monies there were loſt. Thus one affliction is added to another, and miſery, like waves, tread one on the others heel: And now who could have otherwiſe thought, but that with this ſad diſaſter, the work it ſelf would have been layd aſide: but yet that great God that gave the firſt motion, continued the reſolutions. And on conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a good effect in the end this laſt year, 1646. Both Houſes were pleaſed againe to ſet forth a ſhip of ſtrength, called the <hi>Charles,</hi> with a Gargaſoon of money and goods: ſending the ſaid <hi>Edmond Caſon</hi> Eſq. again their Agent with the like power and commiſsion at before, for to treat for redemption of the Captives, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a firme peace. In proſecution of which orders, the ſaid Agent, ſhip, and goods, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the voyage, and God hath ſo bleſſed the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:159930:4"/>work that they arived at that Port in ſafety: where after a long and difficult treaty, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of the Captives is taken, wherein are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled the names of all that are upon that place, and the price for their ranſome agreed on, as they firſt coſt in the market: that Gargaſoon of money and goods that was ſent out, hath by the Agent been ſo well managed, as that 244 perſons, men, women &amp; children, are redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſent home in the ſaid ſhip, the <hi>Charles:</hi> the Agent is conſtrained to ſtay there, untill ſuch time as the remainder are likewiſe redeemed. In preparation to the diſpatch wherof, two ſhips are now providing to be ſent thither with a greater Gargaſoon then before: and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that all may receive ſatisfaction concerning the proceedings of the treaty, the number of the perſons there captives, the names of the perſons redeemed and brought home. The courſe taken for, thoſe at Tunnis, here followeth, the extract of the Letters of the Agent Mr. <hi>Caſon,</hi> the Liſt of the perſons redeemed, and the tranſlation in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of the Letters from the Baſha, the Duana, the Mufty, Caddee and Shoudes, unto both Houſes of Parliament.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ay it pleaſe you, we arived at this Port in ſafety, thanks be to GOD, the 21 of September; the Baſha and Duana ſent me a ſafe conduct the next day: I went on ſhoar, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered my Letters to the Baſha, who had order from the Duana to treat with me, and deſired to know my buſineſſe ſo I delivered him, and ſome of the Duana my credentiall Letters, and then adviſed them my commands from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, both for complaints, and the joyning perpetuall peace, and deſired the ſubjects of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to be delivered unto me free, for wee had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:159930:5"/>not broke the peace with them: they anſwered they conſented a peace, but the Slaves were ſold unto divers men, ſouldiers, and others, who would not deliver them without paying for them what they firſt coſt in the market, as ſhould appear by their books. Being not content with this anſwer, I deſired my Letters (being then tranſlated) to be read in the Duana, to have the anſwer from the Baſha and Duana when they were in councell, the which they conſented: the next Saturday (being the day of their ſitting) the 26 <hi>Ditto,</hi> I had the ſame anſwer by the Trudgeman; and for all things I was againe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to treat with the Baſha, this day the peace was concluded and proclaimed in the Duana.</p>
                  <p>The Baſha entertained me with all courteſie, feaſted me at his houſe, and afterwards in the fields.</p>
                  <p>Then I deſired to take a regiſter of all the Engliſh there detained as Captives; and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very owner of an Engliſh captive might come with his ſlave before me, and a Scrivener of this place to declare his ſlaves name, and what he coſt him the firſt penny, the which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred by us both; and further took the place he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:159930:5"/>was of, his age, and what ſhip he was taken in, and how many years paſt. I was informed that divers Turks and Moores cauſed us to ſet down much more then their ſlaves coſt, the which I did adviſe the Baſha; he ſwore by the head of his maſter, the great Turk, I ſhould pay not an Aſper more then they coſt in the market, at the firſt ſale when they were brought on ſhoar. The regiſter being taken of thoſe which be here, there are 650 and upwards, beſides above an too in the ſhips of this place, now at Candia in the ſervice of the great Turk. And after payment of the 10000 dollors, bagreed to give him ſix <hi>per cent.</hi> for what money I ſhould import to pay the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of ſlaves, otherwiſe muſt have paid ten <hi>per cent.</hi> Then alſo we agreed for his duties for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of the ſlaves 20 Peſas <hi>per</hi> man to the Baſha, and to the Officers half duties; all which comes unto 31½ Dollars <hi>per</hi> ſlave, without agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they would have coſt about 50 Dollars a man for charges.</p>
                  <p>Divers of the Engliſh Youths bee turned Turks, through beating and hard uſage; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers children, the which they keep very gallant, but the young men (after turned) they carry to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and other parts to the Eaſtwards.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:159930:6"/>
                  <p>Now for the freeing of the Captives, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is, that it may be done with all brevity, and with ready money, whileſt this Baſha is here. The greateſt part of the inhabitants had rather keep their ſlaves then permit them to be freed: they come to much more <hi>per</hi> head then I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the reaſon is, here be many women and children which coſt 50 l. <hi>per</hi> head firſt penny, and might ſell them for an 100. Beſides them there are divers which were Maſters of ſhips and Carpenters, Caulkers, Coopers, Sailemakers, Chirurgions, and others which are here highly eſteemed; ſo that they doe come unto 32 l. <hi>per</hi> man firſt penny, as they have rated them one with another, and the port charges is 6 l: 6 s. <hi>per</hi> head, ſo they will be about 38 l. <hi>per</hi> head put a ſhip board. I deſired to have agreed with them at a certain price one with another, old &amp; yong; That they would not conſent unto, aleaging, that they were bought at ſeverall prices, and it would make trouble amongſt them: the King hath promiſed I ſhall not be wronged.</p>
                  <p>I have all things under their hands and ſeals; the originall peace according to the ancient capitulations renewed under the hand of the Baſha, Duana, as alſo under the hand and ſeal
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:159930:6"/>of the Muſty and Caddee, and Shoudes, which be principall Juſtices of the peace.</p>

                  <p>MY laſt was 29 October: They of this place doe expect that our ſhips ſhould not defend any other Nation which ſhal bee in our Company from the ſhips of this place. I thought to have taken away the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort of the people firſt, and the reſt afterwards, the which I underſtood to be the command gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me: but it pleaſed God ſo to order, that I muſt take away thoſe I could have for cloth, and leave the reſt till afterwards. The Baſha pleaſed to tell me, when we had difference, that ſeeing I had taken the Regiſter of the Engliſh, and their price, I ſhould clear them before I went hence.</p>
                  <p>For the money ſet down, I perſwade my ſelf you ſhall have your people free; for both Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and French have their protections perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when they come to clear ſlaves from this place:</p>

I beſeech your Honors not to think that this redemption may be part one year, and part another: and I deſire your people may go home in Summer, for I do aſſure you, their clothes be thin. I think two good ſhips and a Pinnace, will be fit to fetch away the reſt of the ſlaves.</p>
